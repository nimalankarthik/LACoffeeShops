# 🗺️ Explore LA Coffee Shops on the Map

Application: LA Coffee Shops Map

Overview:

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on. It's an interactive map application that helps you discover coffee shops in Los Angeles, specifically in the vibrant area of West LA. Let me take you through the key details of this project:

Tech Stack:

⚛️ React: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

🚀 Vite: We used Vite for fast and efficient development and bundling.

🌐 ESRI JavaScript API: The core of our application relies on ESRI's JavaScript API, which provides powerful mapping and geospatial capabilities.

Features:

🗺️ Interactive Map: The heart of this application is an interactive map that showcases the West LA area.

☕ Coffee Shops: Coffee shops are marked on the map, making it easy for users to locate their favorite caffeine spots.

🏢 Location Details: When you click on a coffee shop, you can view its name and address, helping you decide which one to visit.

🕒 Travel Times: The application goes a step further by showing you how long it takes to reach various places from the selected coffee shop. It displays three different shades of blue to represent different travel times:

🏁 Dark Blue: Within 5 minutes

🏁 Medium Blue: Within 10 minutes

🏁 Light Blue: Within 15 minutes

Deployment:

I've deployed this application on Vercel. The deployment process was smooth, and it allows you to experience the app in your browser. Feel free to explore the coffee shops and their surroundings right now!

Credits:

This project wouldn't have been possible without ESRI's "Find Locations in LA West Coffee Shops" services API and tutorials on the documentation page, which provides the data for the coffee shop locations and the travel time calculations.

Please check out the application and let me know what you think! Your feedback is valuable as we continue to improve and enhance this mapping experience.
